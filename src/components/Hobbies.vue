          <h3>Tech-testing</h3>
          I frequently explore technologies that captivate my curiosity. Lately,
          I've been crafting a strong, scalable Laravel PHP backend, using it as
          a foundation for a forthcoming business's full-stack solution.
          Previously, I've built games using Godot and Unity engines and
          experimented with web frameworks including Vue, Svelte, and Angular.

          <h3>Music Production</h3>
          Ever since a young age, I have loved music. I learned how to play the
          piano and as its timbre is limited, I naturally learned how to create
          modern electronic music, of-which I post on most platforms. I've found
          it ties in with mathamatics and creativity perfectly and has tied into
          other genres of my life. I donâ€™t boast about this enough, though from
          afar, anyone could see it as at least an outline of what I relish.

          <h3>Outdoors and Nature</h3>
          I enjoy hiking as it's a great way to disconnect from the office
          routine. Walking outdoors sparks my creativity and often helps me come
          up with solutions to problems, even though it might mean a long way
          back sometimes! Climbing Ben Nevis has been a highlight for me, and
          I'm excited to tackle more Munros in the future.
